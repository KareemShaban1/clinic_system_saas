-- Permissions :
   - I add permissions from "RolePermissionSeeder" in "seeders" folder 
   - to add permission to controller , I use "AuthorizeCheck" trait 
   - I use "spatie" package to manage roles and permissions

-- Patient Controller notes :
   - In this code, the Patient, Reservation, and Settings models are 
     injected into the constructor of the PatientController class. 
     This allows you to access the injected models using $this->patient, 
     $this->reservation, and $this->settings within the class methods.
   - By using Dependency Injection, the code becomes more flexible, maintainable,
     and testable. It also promotes better separation of concerns by 
     allowing you to easily swap out dependencies or mock them during testing.

--  ChronicDiseasesController
   - In the updated code, the Reservation and ChronicDisease models are injected into 
     the constructor. This allows Laravel's service container to automatically resolve 
     the dependencies when creating an instance of the ChronicDiseasesController class.

-- RaysController 

   - Utilize Model Dependency Injection:
     Instead of using the GlassesDistance and Reservation models directly 
     in the controller methods, you can utilize model dependency injection 
     by type hinting the corresponding models in the method parameters.
